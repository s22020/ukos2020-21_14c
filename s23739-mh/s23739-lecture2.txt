 
My diary, after today's UKOS lectures (07-11-2020), I've learned:
-How to set default permissions and edit them with cmask and chmod
-How to get to Szuflandia with terminal and create directories in there
-About Text Browsers like w3m or links
I am slowly getting used to linux, but it is still pretty difficult, also lectures today were great!


Exercises
============
1. Create few directories and files inside of home directory. Give each of them other rights,
get into home directories of colleagues and check how available are those files for you (and how).
Try to create a file named "kuku≈Çcze jajo.txt" and try to remove some of the files that other left
in your directory.
-Done. Because of not having permissions to read some files, some of them are invisible,
without "x" permission, I can't do anything with a file and without permission to write i am unable
to write (who would have thought!)

2. In your structure of directories, try to:
- Remove all permissions to current directory
- Remove all permissions to parent directory 
When can you use cd? When can you use chmod? Can you get to XYZ with permissions only to XYZ if ABC/XYZ ?

-After removing all perms to curr dir. I am unable to do much
After removing all perms to par dir. I can do whatever i want in current directory but i for example i cant get out simply typing cd ../
I cant use cd when stuck inside of parent directory, i am unable to get to XYZ without perms to ABC

3. Already Done

4. Already Done and not working ://

5. Read about umask in man. Try changing mask, creating some files and checking permissions to files.
- Okay so default mask for me was 002. After changing it into 004, every created file
had "773" permissions. So there is a formula (777-umask)=file permissions

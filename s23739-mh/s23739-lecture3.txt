My diary, after today's UKOS lectures (21-11-2020), I've learned:

-Meaning and usage of commands:
	+ps - Shows a list of ongoing processess
	+grep - Searches for a given phrase
	+kill - Asks for closing a task
	+tar - Compresses a file
	+bg
	+fg
Combining these commands with symbols of stream redirection (?) may give interesting results.
	+">" is used for overwriting. Input>File
	+">>" is used for adding.
	+"2>" and "2>>" is the same as the above with the exception of saving the output into the stderr stream.
	+"<" is used for loading a program with a file as an input. Program<File
	+"|" is used for using the output of a program as an input for another. output1|input2
Example: ps -au root | grep n > root_ps_with_n.txt

-Difference between CTRL+D and CTRL+C where first shuts down a program, and second stops the output stream and shuts down a program
resulting in saving recent changes in a file.
-Usage of CTRL+Z
-Difference between gzip and bzip2. gzip is faster but bzip2 reduces the size better
-I should always update my local git repository before creating a pull request


Lectures were really informative and removed any doubts out of my head.
However, I felt really bad when our group when asked to volunteer, went quiet.
I know this feeling because i also have been quiet. It is just being terrified of making a mistake but
this is not how it should look like, we are learning and mistakes are unavoidable.
This annoyed our lecturer since he gave his best to teach us and we acted really uncooperative.
Next time I will try to change that.
The lecture was great!

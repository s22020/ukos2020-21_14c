My diary, after today's(17-10-2020) UKO lesson, I've learned:
1. How to create and use GIT repository
2. How to navigate linux/ubuntu through terminal. Most important commands here seem to be:
- cd - 
- ls -l - for showind folder content in a list
3. What each of the system folder contains and that is:
bin - binaries, (executable files/shortcuts)
boot - files for booting/starting the system 
dev - devices like dvd-rom, fd(floppy-drive), null(bin in windows), random - device that generates random numbers/letters, zero - useful for nullifying disks
etc - inside are config files for various things like servers or programming languages like php python etc.
home - user's files
lib - libraries (like dll's in windows) 
lost+found - recovered files
media - external drives/cellphones(in disk mode), cd/dvd
mnt - like above but for manual mounting of drives etc.
opt - optional 
proc - processes
root - admin's folder with special privleges accesible only to admin
run - when program starts it makes a text document(PID) with process' number that can be found in proc folder
sbin - system binaries/ don't mess with it if you don't know what you are doing
srv - server folder
sys - system files
tmp - temporary files(like in windows)
usr - database data for example/ useful files
var - variable logs, www sites
4. Relative and absolute pathnames (check http://szuflandia.pjwstk.edu.pl:9000) student/student for more info
